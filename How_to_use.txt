To play with the bots, you need:
-NodeJS (https://nodejs.org/en/)
-Tampermonkey (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo)

In config.js, you can choose the max of bots, the server where bots are running (Do not change if bots are running
on your computer) and you can choose the Package Key.
In userscript.js you have the userscript that you have to copy and then go to Tampermonkey and add a new userscript
and paste the userscript. (TURN OFF ALL OTHER USERSCRIPT/EXTENSION OR BOTS WON'T WORKS)

Now, to start the bots:
1) Run GetProxy.bat OR put your own proxies in proxy.txt
2) Run start.bat
3) Go to Dual-agar.me and enter your Package Key.
4) Click on the button "Start Bots" to start the bots (Use JF tag to see bots on minimap)

Problem: If you don't see the GUI (the box with bots information and the "Start Bots" button), Close the tab of 
Dual and open it again until you see the GUI.


Hope you enjoy !
